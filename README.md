# Analysis_Housing_Dataset

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on exploring and understanding a housing dataset. The goal of this project is to gain insights into the factors influencing housing prices and potentially build predictive models for future valuations.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is the California Housing dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices). The dataset contains information about various properties in California, including features like median income, house age, average number of rooms, and latitude/longitude. The target variable is the median house value.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

*   **`housing.csv`**: The housing dataset used in the analysis.
*   **`Analysis_Housing_Dataset.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook used for data exploration, analysis, and model building.
*   **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Project Stack

This project utilizes the following key technologies and libraries:

*   **Language:** Python

*   **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)

*   **Data Handling:** Pandas

*   **Visualization:** Matplotlib

*   **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn

## Prerequisites
