# Analysis_Housing_Dataset

This repository contains an analysis of a housing dataset.  The specific analysis performed is not explicitly detailed in the provided files, but the code suggests an exploration of housing prices and potentially related features.  Further documentation within the code itself should provide more specific information.

## Features and Functionality

Based on the available files, the analysis likely includes:

* **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** The code handles loading and likely cleaning the housing dataset.  Further details on specific cleaning steps are not provided.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  The codebase likely performs EDA to understand the distribution of variables and identify potential relationships.
* **Model Building (Potential):** The presence of `.ipynb` files suggests the possibility of model building, though the specific models used aren't clear from the given information.


## Technology Stack

* **Python:** The primary programming language used.
* **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb):** Used for data analysis and visualization.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis. (Inferred from common usage in data analysis projects.)
* **Matplotlib/Seaborn (Potential):** used for data visualization.
* **Scikit-learn (Potential):** Potentially used for model building.


## Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* Required Python packages:  The exact packages will need to be determined by inspecting the `requirements.txt` file (if it exists).  If not present, install the likely necessary packages: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`.  Use pip: `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn`


## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository:  `git clone https://github.com/mha0376/Analysis_Housing_Dataset.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Analysis_Housing_Dataset`
3. Create a virtual environment (recommended): `python3 -m venv venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment:
    * On Linux/macOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
    * On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
5. Install dependencies:  (Refer to `requirements.txt` if it exists; otherwise, use the command from Prerequisites)
6. Open Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`


## Usage Guide

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook files (e.g.,  `*.ipynb`) in your Jupyter Notebook environment.
2. Execute the cells sequentially to run the analysis.
3. Examine the outputs and visualizations generated by the notebooks.

The specific steps and interpretations will depend on the content of each `.ipynb` file.


## API Documentation

Not applicable. This project is primarily focused on data analysis and doesn't expose any APIs.
